                  following results emerge: In the absorption spectrum
                  of an alternant radical there should appear two long
                  wavelength bands. These arise jointly from
                  excitations of electrons into and out of the singly
                  occupied orbital. The lower frequency band should be
                  weak, and the higher frequency band relatively
                  strong. The existence of a low-lying quartet level
                  is also predicted. The absorption spectra of the
                  corresponding anion and cation should be closely
                  related, the lowest two excited states being for
                  both types of ion a triplet and a singlet. The
                  singlet-triplet separation in the ions should be
                  roughly equal to the separation of the two low-lying
                  doublets of the radical. These generalizations are

  abstract =     {With increasing availability of good all-electron
                  LCAO MO (LCAO molecular orbital) wave functions for
                  molecules, a systematic procedure for obtaining
                  maximum insight from such data has become
                  desirable. An analysis in quantitative form is given
                  here in terms of breakdowns of the electronic
                  population into partial and total ''gross atomic
                  populations,'' or into partial and total ''net
                  atomic populations'' together with ''overlap
                  populations.'' ''Gross atomic populations''
                  distribute the electrons almost perfectly among the
                  various AOs (atomic orbitals) of the various atoms
                  in the molecule. From these numbers, a definite
                  figure is obtained for the amount of promotion
                  (e.g., from 2s to 2p) in each atom; and also for the
                  gross charge Q on each atom if the bonds are
                  polar. The total overlap population for any pair of
                  atoms in a molecule is in general made up of
                  positive and negative contributions. If the total
                  overlap population between two atoms is positive,
                  they are bonded; if negative, they are
                  antibonded.Tables of gross atomic populations and
                  overlap populations, also gross atomic charges Q,
                  computed from SCF (self-consistent field) LCAO-MO
                  data on CO and H2O, are given. The amount of s-p
                  promotion is found to be nearly the same for the O
                  atom in CO and in H2O (0.14 electron in CO and 0.15e
                  in H2O). For the C atom in CO it is 0.50e. For the N
                  atom in N2 it is 0.26e according to calculations by
                  Scherr. In spite of very strong polarity in the $\pi$
                  bonds in CO, the $\sigma$ and $\pi$ overlap populations
                  are very similar to those in N2. In CO the total
                  overlap population for the $\pi$ electrons is about
                  twice that for the $\sigma$ electrons. The most easily
                  ionized electrons of CO are in an MO such that its
                  gross atomic population is 94% localized on the
                  carbon atom; these electrons account for the (weak)
                  electron donor properties of CO. A comparison
                  between changes of bond lengths observed on removal
                  of an electron from one or another MO of CO and H2,
                  and corresponding changes in computed overlap
                  populations, shows good correlation. Several other
                  points of interest are discussed.}

                  energies than do LCAO bond orders. They are
                  immediately applicable to both pi and sigma bonds,
                  including bonds involving hybrid AOs of all kinds,
                  and they take account directly of the effects of
                  variations in bond length on bond strength. In the
                  last section of this paper, a number of ways of
                  defining LCAO bond orders are reviewed, and their
                  advantages and disadvantages discussed.If all LCAO
                  parameters beta are assumed proportional to
                  corresponding overlap integrals S times suitable

                  general approximate formula for covalent resonance
                  energies is obtained in terms of partial overlap
                  populations and {\=I}'s, including one or two
                  empirical coefficients. This formula indicates that
                  forced hybridization (see III of this series) due to
                  inner shells should make important negative
                  contributions to bond energies. The application of
                  the formula to H2, CO, and H2O is discussed.The
                  assumption of proportionality of beta values to
                  SI-bar values may be useful also in estimating
                  unknown beta values.}

                  overlap populations for LCAO-MO electron
                  configurations are discussed in terms of some simple
                  examples, using equations and graphs. The validity
                  of ''gross AO populations'' as true measures of the
                  population in various AOs is critically
                  discussed. It is shown that the degree of
                  hybridization in the AOs of an LCAO MO does not in
                  general give the true amount of s or p character in
                  the MO; this is given instead by the gross s or p
                  population in the MO. Nevertheless, ''forced
                  hybridization'' among the AOs, although not
                  contributing to gross AO populations, leads to
                  important negative contributions to overlap
                  populations, hence to bond energies. For example,
                  forced 2s-2p hybridization has the result that
                  the total overlap population for two pairs of
                  electrons occupying bonding $\sigma$ LCAO MOs built
                  from 2s and 2p $\sigma$ AOs in a homopolar diatomic
                  molecule is actually less than the sum of the
                  overlap populations which one would have if one pair
                  could be in an MO built from pure 2s AOs and the
                  other in an MO built from pure 2p $\sigma$ AOs. This
                  sort of forced hybridization with resultant loss of
                  bond strength may explain why double bonds seldom if
                  ever consist of two $\sigma$ bonds.}

                  the assumed case of no s[Single Bond]p
                  hybridization, and for the actual case with
                  hybridization. It is pointed out that repulsions
                  between nonbonded atoms in VB theory (including
                  those which give rise to steric hindrance) have
                  their counterpart in negative overlap populations
                  between the same atoms in LCAO theory. The $\pi$
                  overlap populations for the various links in
                  1,3-butadiene are computed by LCAO theory. It is
                  shown how they are affected by conjugation (see
                  Table I) and the results are compared with those of
                  VB theory.}

It is a measure of the degree of electron sharing of the given atom with the other atoms. Its properties such as invariance to rotation of the coordinate system, its limiting values as well as its relation to natural hybrids and bond orbitals are discussed.",

The simplex adapts itself to the local landscape, and contracts on to the final minimum. The method is shown to be effective and computationally compact. A procedure is given for the estimation of the Hessian matrix in the neighbourhood of the minimum, needed in statistical estimation problems.},

	Phys. 96, 2856 (1992)] we present an alternative definition of natural

	can be generated for any molecular topology, no matter how complicated,
	and is fully nonredundant. Using an appropriate Schmidt‐orthogonalization
	procedure, all standard bond length, bond angle, and dihedral angle
	constraints can be imposed within our internal coordinate scheme.
	Combinatorial constraints (in which sums or differences of stretches,
	bends, and torsions remain constant) can also be imposed. Optimizations
	on some fairly large systems (50–100 atoms) show that delocalized
	internal coordinates are far superior to Cartesians even with reliable
	Hessian information available at the starting geometry.},
